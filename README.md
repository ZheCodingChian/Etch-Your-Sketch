## 🛠️ Technologies Used
-  **HTML5** for structure.
-  **CSS3** for styling and Flexbox layout.
-  **JavaScript (ES6)** for interactivity.
-  **Git & GitHub Pages** for version control and deployment.

## 🎓 Key Learning Outcomes
-  **DOM Manipulation**: Create, modify, and dynamically inject elements.
-  **CSS Flexbox**: Build responsive and adaptive layouts.
-  **Event Handling**: Master interactions using mouse and keyboard events.
  
## ⭐ Features
-  **Dynamic Grid**: Customize the grid size from 1x1 up to 100x100.
-  **Drawing Modes**: Switch between drawing, random colors, or erasing.
-  **Interactive**: Enjoy responsive drawing using both mouse click and drag interactions.

## 🔍 How It Works
-  A nested for-loop generates rows and columns of 'pixels' in a flexbox.
-  Event listeners capture mouse and keyboard actions for real-time drawing on the canvas.
-  Random color generator utilies 'Math.random()' to generate RGB values.
